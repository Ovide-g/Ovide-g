## 🚀 About Me

At Raritan Valley Community College, *I am a student*. Currently, I am in a program for computer programming and interface design web development. Coding is something I am passionate about learning. Right now, I'm working on improving my README file using Markdown. JavaScript and Object Oriented Programming are currently two subjects I am learning. As a web developer student, I enjoy working with HTML and CSS, Jamstack, Markdown.

### Fun fact: 
 + Foreign money is something I collect.
