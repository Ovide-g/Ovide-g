## 🚀 About Me

At Raritan Valley Community College, *I am a student*. Currently, I am in a program for computer programming and interface design web development. Coding is something I am passionate about learning. I am currently working on improving my README file using Markdown. At the moment, I am learning JavaScript and Object Oriented Programming.


**Ovide-g/Ovide-g** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ⏳ Right now, I'm working on improving my README file using Markdown.
- 📘 JavaScript and Object Oriented Programming are currently two subjects I am learning.
- 💶 Fun fact: Foreign money is something I collect.
- 🧭 You can ask me questions about HTML and CSS.
